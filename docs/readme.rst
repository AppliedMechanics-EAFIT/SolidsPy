A simple finite element analysis code for 2D elasticity problems.
The code uses as input simple-to-create text files
defining a model in terms of nodal, element, material and load data.

Features
--------

* It is based on an open-source environment.

* It is easy to use.

* The code allows to find displacement, strain and stress solutions for
  arbitrary two-dimensional domains discretized into finite elements and
  subject to point loads.

* The code is organized in independent modules for pre-processing, assembly and
  post-processing allowing the user to easily modify it or add features like
  new elements or analyses pipelines.

* It was created with academic and research purposes.

* It has been used to tech the following courses:

  - Computational Modeling.
  - Introduction to the Finite Element Methods.


Installation
------------

The code is written in Python and it depends on ``numpy``, and ``scipy``
and. It has been tested under Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

To install *SolidsPy* open a terminal and type:

::

    pip install solidspy

To specify through a GUI the folder where the input
files are stored  you will need to install `easygui <http://easygui.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`__.

To easily generate the required SolidsPy text files out of a
`Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`__ model you will need
`meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__.

These two can be installed with:

::

    pip install easygui
    pip install meshio


How to run a simple model
-------------------------

For further explanation check the `docs <http://solidspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Let's suppose that we have a simple model represented by the following
files (see `tutorials/square example <http://solidspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/square_example.html>`__
for further explanation).

Run it in Python as follows:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # load matplotlib
    from solidspy import solids_GUI  # import our package
    disp = solids_GUI()  # run the Finite Element Analysis
    plt.show()    # plot contours

For Mac users it is suggested to use an IPython console to run the example.
